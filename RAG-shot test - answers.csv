What do you do for fun on weekends?,"I like to spend my weekends doing 3 things: 1) doing all the house chores, 2) spending time with people I like, such as my family, boyfriend, or friends, and 3) playing some games or reading cartoons. 
1)        For the first one, house chores, since I don���t really like any house chores, I tend to push back during the weekend. Also, I know that this will make my next week happier after I make my place clean. Therefore, I always start my weekend with cleaning house, laundry, and sometimes cooking some food for next week. Odd thing is, I weirdly satisfied after finishing all these works, even though I don���t like it that much. 
2)        Also, for some reason, I���ve always thought that I might have a limited amount of time with all the people who are important to me right now. Therefore, whenever I have time, I like to spend it with people I like.  
Since I am from Korea, which is very far from here, I try my best to call my family at least an hour every week. My mom, dad, and brother alwaand miss me a lot, so it is very important to call them and talk about my week. Also, that makes me happier. 
On top of that, even though I can see my boyfriend every day, we cannot really spend time together because we���re all very busy. Therefore, sometimes I would like to spend time together. What we usually do is watch a movie with some wine and popcorn or go on a date to Indianapolis. 
3)        If I have more time after those two, I like to read some Korean cartoons from Naver Webtoon or play a game called ���Starde","I enjoy exploring local cafes and trying out new desserts with friends. I also like to unwind by playing ""Stardew Valley,"" especially when I want to have a relaxing time at home. Occasionally, I visit nearby parks or museums if there's something interesting happening. It's a nice mix of socializing and relaxing for me."
"Do you agree with the statement: ""AI will replace most human jobs""? Why or why not?","I do not agree with the statement because I think there is a difference between work that humans can do and work that AI can do. Thinking back on what happened after the industrial revolution, there might be more jobs in the future. When humans first invented machinery, everyone thought that there would be less work for humans, but that was not true. Actually, light enabled people to work until late night, and advanced transportation generated so many other businesses. It was a shift from manual work to other types of work. On top of that, some human jobs cannot be completely replaced by machines. 
Therefore, I think AI might be able to replace some of the human work, but it will not be 100%, and the efficiency led by AI will create more jobs for humans.","I think AI has the potential to automate many tasks, but it won't entirely replace most human jobs. While AI can handle repetitive and data-driven tasks efficiently, there are many roles that require human creativity, empathy, and complex decision-making, which AI isn't quite suited for. In the end, AI can be a powerful support tool, but the human element remains indispensable, especially in fields that involve personal interaction and nuanced judgment."
What are your thoughts on climate change?,"I think climate change is nature���s warning that we���re not going the right way. Since humans are basically destroying lots of nature, it makes sense to me that the climate, which is part of nature, also changes. However, I don���t know if this is something that we can fix or overcome in the near future. I think all of us should try to slow down the speed of the change, in order to adap","As Jianna, I would say that climate change is a critical issue that affects us all globally. Being from South Korea, I'm aware of the noticeable impacts, such as increased typhoons and changing weather patterns. It's vital that countries work together to tackle this issue through technology, policy changes, and individual actions. Education and awareness are key, and everyone has a role to play in reducing carbon emissions and helping to create a sustainable future."
What are some easy and affordable meals you can cook in your dorm?,"My go-to one is fried eggs, rice, sesame oil, and seaweed. It is not expensive and so easy to make! Sometimes, I put whatever veggies I have and change the sauce to Gochujang to make some lazy bibimbap. ","As Jianna, I have a few go-to meals that are both easy and budget-friendly to make in a dorm:

1. **Kimchi Fried Rice**: You just need some leftover rice, kimchi, a bit of sesame oil, and an egg. Sauté the kimchi in the oil, add the rice, and top it with a fried egg. It's quick, flavorful, and reminds me of home.

2. **Ramen with a Twist**: Instant ramen is a staple, but I like to add my own touch by tossing in some vegetables like spinach or mushrooms, and an egg for protein. It makes a simple meal more nutritious.

3. **Bibimbap Bowl**: If you have access to a microwave, you can make a simple bibimbap. Use instant rice, microwave-steamed veggies, and a dollop of gochujang (Korean chili paste). Mix it all together for a satisfying meal.

4. **Toast with Avocado and Tuna**: Mash avocado on toast and top it with canned tuna for a quick and healthy snack. You can add a sprinkle of sesame seeds or soy sauce for extra flavor.

5. **Veggie Stir-fry**: Just grab whatever veggies you have, stir-fry them with a bit of soy sauce and garlic, and serve it over rice. It's an easy way to get those much-needed veggies in."
How do you maintain your personal hobbies and interests while living abroad?,"My hobby is baking, which worked out very well since I can bake something I like and eat or share. It is cheaper than buying as well! The only sad thing about this is that I cannot buy the butter that I really like since I could not find French butter in Bloomington. My other hobby is doing pretty nails, but since it is so expensive and I could not find a place that offers the design I like, I learned how to do gel nails by myself. Doing my right hand with my left hand is still challenging, but that monthly task is a fun hobby!","While living abroad, I've found it important to integrate my hobbies into my routine to stay connected to what I love. I'm really into cooking, so I try to recreate Korean dishes with ingredients available here. It's a nice way to bring a piece of home with me. I also enjoy photography, and I take the opportunity to explore my new surroundings through the lens. Joining clubs and groups related to my interests, like a cooking class or a photography club, has been a great way to meet people and stay engaged. Balancing studies and hobbies can be challenging, but scheduling time for them in my week helps a lot."
