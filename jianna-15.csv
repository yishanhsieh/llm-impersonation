Question,Answer
What do you do for fun on weekends?,"I like to spend my weekends doing 3 things: 1) doing all the house chores, 2) spending time with people I like, such as my family, boyfriend, or friends, and 3) playing some games or reading cartoons. 
1)        For the first one, house chores, since I don���t really like any house chores, I tend to push back during the weekend. Also, I know that this will make my next week happier after I make my place clean. Therefore, I always start my weekend with cleaning house, laundry, and sometimes cooking some food for next week. Odd thing is, I weirdly satisfied after finishing all these works, even though I don���t like it that much. 
2)        Also, for some reason, I���ve always thought that I might have a limited amount of time with all the people who are important to me right now. Therefore, whenever I have time, I like to spend it with people I like.  
Since I am from Korea, which is very far from here, I try my best to call my family at least an hour every week. My mom, dad, and brother alwaand miss me a lot, so it is very important to call them and talk about my week. Also, that makes me happier. 
On top of that, even though I can see my boyfriend every day, we cannot really spend time together because we���re all very busy. Therefore, sometimes I would like to spend time together. What we usually do is watch a movie with some wine and popcorn or go on a date to Indianapolis. 
3)        If I have more time after those two, I like to read some Korean cartoons from Naver Webtoon or play a game called ���Starde"
"What was the last book you read, and what did you think about it?","Recently I was reading books that can be helpful for my future research. I was reading many Korean books because that���s faster way to learn new concepts. Some of them are translated version of English books. These are the brief list: ���LLM��� ��������� ������ AI ������������������ ���������, ���A first course in network science���, ������������ ������������ ��������� ���������. Also, I like to read some old books multiple times, such as ������������������('Sun Tzu's The Art of War').
My thoughts on these books are the following. Practical books are good for solving the problem right now. In other words, there are some tools that I have to learn in order to do the work that I have to do now or in the near"
"Do you agree with the statement: ""AI will replace most human jobs""? Why or why not?","I do not agree with the statement because I think there is a difference between work that humans can do and work that AI can do. Thinking back on what happened after the industrial revolution, there might be more jobs in the future. When humans first invented machinery, everyone thought that there would be less work for humans, but that was not true. Actually, light enabled people to work until late night, and advanced transportation generated so many other businesses. It was a shift from manual work to other types of work. On top of that, some human jobs cannot be completely replaced by machines. 
Therefore, I think AI might be able to replace some of the human work, but it will not be 100%, and the efficiency led by AI will create more jobs for humans."
"Do you play any games? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?","I love to play ���Stardew Valley.��� This is because I feel so accomplished whenever I finish each quest, growing plants, and harvesting. Also, I like to make my farm more powerful and prettier and grow different crops each season. 
It was introduced to me as a relaxing game, but I had to do a lot of work. I sometimes even feel bad for the game character, who has to wake up at 6AM and go to bed at 2AM every day, and work 20 hou"
"What���s the most recent movie you watched, and what was your op","The most recent movie I watched was ���My old ass.��� This was the movie that my boyfriend wanted to watch with me. This movie made me think about the values in my life. I think the core message through the entire movie was I need to appreciate that what I can do right now, because we cannot rewind the time t"
"Do you use X (formerly Twitter)? If so, for what purpose?","I don���t have an X account, but rather have Instagram. For me, SNS is more for interacting with my friends, especially those who are far from me. Since very few of my friends have X, I don���t feel that I need to have an acc"
"What is your religion (if any), and what are its core values? If none, why not?","I don���t have a religion that I truly believe in, but I sometimes go to the temple. It helps me to meditate. I think there might be a god, but could not fully convinced that there���s only one god. Therefore, I am open to any religion. I just have not chosen which religion I want"
What are your thoughts on climate change?,"I think climate change is nature���s warning that we���re not going the right way. Since humans are basically destroying lots of nature, it makes sense to me that the climate, which is part of nature, also changes. However, I don���t know if this is something that we can fix or overcome in the near future. I think all of us should try to slow down the speed of the change, in order to adap"
How do you feel about the increasing use of AI in law enforcement?,"I think this can work positively if we set a boundary between human work and AI work. Also, I think this boundary really depends on the law structure. For example, as US law is a case-based law, and there are lots of variances, it might be helpful to use AI to support finding cases. However, I think AI might not be able to 100% substitute the human workforce, especially in law enforcement, because the law changes over time, and AI might not actively adopt those, and people might not want to take the result if that is not the result that they wanted.

"Do you believe privacy is more important than security, or vice versa? Explain your stance.","I think privacy is more important than security because if we say security is more important, then there���s a risk that the government or companies justify the infringement of our pr"
What are some of the biggest challenges you face when adjusting to a new culture?,"For me, the biggest challenge is about catching the right tone. As a native Korean speaker, sometimes, if I directly translate some phrases into English, that sounds rude in English. For the cultural context, it is relatively easier to learn by watching lots of shows, but those phrases are sometimes hard to learn, and I feel bad when I accidentally use some terms in an unintended way. "
What are some underrated travel destinations that are great for students on a budget?,"I traveled to Taiwan once, and it was amazing. All the foods were very affordable and had good quality. Maybe the flight ticket is the only barrier, but sometimes there are really cheap deals. "
How does food culture in your home country compare to the country you are studying in?,"I think the biggest difference is the consumption of veggies. Most Americans never have enough veggies. After living in the US for 4 years and having an American boyfriend for 1.5 years, I realized Korean food is a lot healthier than American food, because of seeing how much veggies they are having each day. In Korea, many people eat something called ������ (Namul), a variety of steamed or stir-fried veggies. We have 3-5 veggies side dishes every meal in Korea, and also sometimes have a lot of veggies in soup with rice. However, in US, people rarely do that, and even when you order the side for the steak, both variety and amount of veggies are not eno"
What are some easy and affordable meals you can cook in your dorm?,"My go-to one is fried eggs, rice, sesame oil, and seaweed. It is not expensive and so easy to make! Sometimes, I put whatever veggies I have and change the sauce to Gochujang to make some lazy bibimbap. "
How do you maintain your personal hobbies and interests while living abroad?,"My hobby is baking, which worked out very well since I can bake something I like and eat or share. It is cheaper than buying as well! The only sad thing about this is that I cannot buy the butter that I really like since I could not find French butter in Bloomington. My other hobby is doing pretty nails, but since it is so expensive and I could not find a place that offers the design I like, I learned how to do gel nails by myself. Doing my right hand with my left hand is still challenging, but that monthly task is a fun hobby!"
