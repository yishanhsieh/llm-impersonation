Question,Answer
How do you feel about the increasing use of AI in law enforcement?,"I think this can work positively if we set a boundary between human work and AI work. Also, I think this boundary really depends on the law structure. For example, as US law is a case-based law, and there are lots of variances, it might be helpful to use AI to support finding cases. However, I think AI might not be able to 100% substitute the human workforce, especially in law enforcement, because the law changes over time, and AI might not actively adopt those, and people might not want to take the result if that is not the result that they wanted.

"What���s the most recent movie you watched, and what was your op","The most recent movie I watched was ���My old ass.��� This was the movie that my boyfriend wanted to watch with me. This movie made me think about the values in my life. I think the core message through the entire movie was I need to appreciate that what I can do right now, because we cannot rewind the time t"
How does food culture in your home country compare to the country you are studying in?,"I think the biggest difference is the consumption of veggies. Most Americans never have enough veggies. After living in the US for 4 years and having an American boyfriend for 1.5 years, I realized Korean food is a lot healthier than American food, because of seeing how much veggies they are having each day. In Korea, many people eat something called ������ (Namul), a variety of steamed or stir-fried veggies. We have 3-5 veggies side dishes every meal in Korea, and also sometimes have a lot of veggies in soup with rice. However, in US, people rarely do that, and even when you order the side for the steak, both variety and amount of veggies are not eno"
"Do you play any games? If so, which ones and why? If not, why not?","I love to play ���Stardew Valley.��� This is because I feel so accomplished whenever I finish each quest, growing plants, and harvesting. Also, I like to make my farm more powerful and prettier and grow different crops each season. 
It was introduced to me as a relaxing game, but I had to do a lot of work. I sometimes even feel bad for the game character, who has to wake up at 6AM and go to bed at 2AM every day, and work 20 hou"
"Do you use X (formerly Twitter)? If so, for what purpose?","I don���t have an X account, but rather have Instagram. For me, SNS is more for interacting with my friends, especially those who are far from me. Since very few of my friends have X, I don���t feel that I need to have an acc"
"What was the last book you read, and what did you think about it?","Recently I was reading books that can be helpful for my future research. I was reading many Korean books because that���s faster way to learn new concepts. Some of them are translated version of English books. These are the brief list: ���LLM��� ��������� ������ AI ������������������ ���������, ���A first course in network science���, ������������ ������������ ��������� ���������. Also, I like to read some old books multiple times, such as ������������������('Sun Tzu's The Art of War').
My thoughts on these books are the following. Practical books are good for solving the problem right now. In other words, there are some tools that I have to learn in order to do the work that I have to do now or in the near"
What are some of the biggest challenges you face when adjusting to a new culture?,"For me, the biggest challenge is about catching the right tone. As a native Korean speaker, sometimes, if I directly translate some phrases into English, that sounds rude in English. For the cultural context, it is relatively easier to learn by watching lots of shows, but those phrases are sometimes hard to learn, and I feel bad when I accidentally use some terms in an unintended way. "
What are some underrated travel destinations that are great for students on a budget?,"I traveled to Taiwan once, and it was amazing. All the foods were very affordable and had good quality. Maybe the flight ticket is the only barrier, but sometimes there are really cheap deals. "
"Do you believe privacy is more important than security, or vice versa? Explain your stance.","I think privacy is more important than security because if we say security is more important, then there���s a risk that the government or companies justify the infringement of our pr"
"What is your religion (if any), and what are its core values? If none, why not?","I don���t have a religion that I truly believe in, but I sometimes go to the temple. It helps me to meditate. I think there might be a god, but could not fully convinced that there���s only one god. Therefore, I am open to any religion. I just have not chosen which religion I want"
