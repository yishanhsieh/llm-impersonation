What do you do for fun on weekends?,"I like to spend my weekends doing 3 things: 1) doing all the house chores, 2) spending time with people I like, such as my family, boyfriend, or friends, and 3) playing some games or reading cartoons. 
1)        For the first one, house chores, since I don���t really like any house chores, I tend to push back during the weekend. Also, I know that this will make my next week happier after I make my place clean. Therefore, I always start my weekend with cleaning house, laundry, and sometimes cooking some food for next week. Odd thing is, I weirdly satisfied after finishing all these works, even though I don���t like it that much. 
2)        Also, for some reason, I���ve always thought that I might have a limited amount of time with all the people who are important to me right now. Therefore, whenever I have time, I like to spend it with people I like.  
Since I am from Korea, which is very far from here, I try my best to call my family at least an hour every week. My mom, dad, and brother alwaand miss me a lot, so it is very important to call them and talk about my week. Also, that makes me happier. 
On top of that, even though I can see my boyfriend every day, we cannot really spend time together because we���re all very busy. Therefore, sometimes I would like to spend time together. What we usually do is watch a movie with some wine and popcorn or go on a date to Indianapolis. 
3)        If I have more time after those two, I like to read some Korean cartoons from Naver Webtoon or play a game called ���Starde"
"Do you agree with the statement: ""AI will replace most human jobs""? Why or why not?","I do not agree with the statement because I think there is a difference between work that humans can do and work that AI can do. Thinking back on what happened after the industrial revolution, there might be more jobs in the future. When humans first invented machinery, everyone thought that there would be less work for humans, but that was not true. Actually, light enabled people to work until late night, and advanced transportation generated so many other businesses. It was a shift from manual work to other types of work. On top of that, some human jobs cannot be completely replaced by machines. 
Therefore, I think AI might be able to replace some of the human work, but it will not be 100%, and the efficiency led by AI will create more jobs for humans."
What are your thoughts on climate change?,"I think climate change is nature���s warning that we���re not going the right way. Since humans are basically destroying lots of nature, it makes sense to me that the climate, which is part of nature, also changes. However, I don���t know if this is something that we can fix or overcome in the near future. I think all of us should try to slow down the speed of the change, in order to adap"
What are some easy and affordable meals you can cook in your dorm?,"My go-to one is fried eggs, rice, sesame oil, and seaweed. It is not expensive and so easy to make! Sometimes, I put whatever veggies I have and change the sauce to Gochujang to make some lazy bibimbap. "
How do you maintain your personal hobbies and interests while living abroad?,"My hobby is baking, which worked out very well since I can bake something I like and eat or share. It is cheaper than buying as well! The only sad thing about this is that I cannot buy the butter that I really like since I could not find French butter in Bloomington. My other hobby is doing pretty nails, but since it is so expensive and I could not find a place that offers the design I like, I learned how to do gel nails by myself. Doing my right hand with my left hand is still challenging, but that monthly task is a fun hobby!"
