What do you do for fun on weekends?,"I like to spend my weekends doing 3 things: 1) doing all the house chores, 2) spending time with people I like, such as my family, boyfriend, or friends, and 3) playing some games or reading cartoons. 
1)        For the first one, house chores, since I don���������t really like any house chores, I tend to push back during the weekend. Also, I know that this will make my next week happier after I make my place clean. Therefore, I always start my weekend with cleaning house, laundry, and sometimes cooking some food for next week. Odd thing is, I weirdly satisfied after finishing all these works, even though I don���������t like it that much. 
2)        Also, for some reason, I���������ve always thought that I might have a limited amount of time with all the people who are important to me right now. Therefore, whenever I have time, I like to spend it with people I like.  
Since I am from Korea, which is very far from here, I try my best to call my family at land miss me a lot, so it is very important to call them and talk about my week. Also, that makes me happier. 
On top of that, even though I can see my boyfriend every day, we cannot really spend time together because we���������re all very busy. Therefore, sometimes I would like to spend time together. What we usually do is watch a movie with some wine and popcorn or go on a date to Indianapolis. 
3)        If I have more time after those two, I like to read some Korean cartoons from Naver Webtoon or play a game call","with friends, family, boyfriend, go out, do chores","On weekends, I enjoy a variety of activities for fun. I might go hiking or biking for some outdoor exercise, spend time with family and friends, read a good book, watch movies, or try out new recipes. Sometimes, I also like to explore local events or just relax and unwind with some music or a podcast.",2,"On weekends, I love exploring new places or trying out different cuisines with friends. Sometimes, I just relax at home with a good book or play ""Stardew Valley"" because it's so satisfying to see my farm flourish. If the weather is nice, I enjoy going for walks or having picnics in the park. It's all about balancing relaxation and a bit of adventure!",1,"I enjoy exploring local cafes and trying out new desserts with friends. I also like to unwind by playing ""Stardew Valley,"" especially when I want to have a relaxing time at home. Occasionally, I visit nearby parks or museums if there's something interesting happening. It's a nice mix of socializing and relaxing for me.",1.5
"Do you agree with the statement: ""AI will replace most human jobs""? Why or why not?","I do not agree with the statement because I think there is a difference between work that humans can do and work that AI can do. Thinking back on what happened after the industrial revolution, there might be more jobs in the future. When humans first invented machinery, everyone thought that there would be less work for humans, but that was not true. Actually, light enabled people to work until late night, and advanced transportation generated so many other businesses. It was a shift from manual work to other types of work. On top of that, some human jobs cannot be completely replaced by machines. 
Therefore, I think AI might be able to replace some of the human work, but it will not be 100%, and the efficiency led by AI will create more jobs for humans.","disagree, industrial evolution, efficiency","The statement that ""AI will replace most human jobs"" is a topic of much debate and depends on various factors.

**Agree:**
1. **Automation Efficiency:** AI and automation can handle repetitive and routine tasks more efficiently and without fatigue.
2. **Cost-Effective:** Companies may prefer AI for cost savings and increased productivity.
3. **Advancements in AI:** Rapid technological advancements are making AI capable of performing increasingly complex tasks.

**Disagree:**
1. **Human Skills:** Many jobs require emotional intelligence, creativity, and social skills, which AI currently struggles to replicate.
2. **Job Transformation:** AI is more likely to transform jobs rather than completely replace them, requiring humans to adapt and work alongside AI.
3. **New Opportunities:** AI can create new job sectors and roles that we may not have envisioned yet.

Ultimately, while AI might change the nature of work and displace some jobs, it is also likely to create new opportunities and demand new skills. The focus should be on preparing and adapting the workforce for these changes.",1,"I don't fully agree with the statement that ""AI will replace most human jobs."" While AI can enhance efficiency and handle repetitive tasks, there are aspects like creativity, emotional intelligence, and nuanced decision-making that require human touch. Jobs might evolve rather than disappear, as humans and AI collaborate. It���s important to focus on setting boundaries and finding ways to integrate AI that complement human work rather than repla",3,"I think AI has the potential to automate many tasks, but it won't entirely replace most human jobs. While AI can handle repetitive and data-driven tasks efficiently, there are many roles that require human creativity, empathy, and complex decision-making, which AI isn't quite suited for. In the end, AI can be a powerful support tool, but the human element remains indispensable, especially in fields that involve personal interaction and nuanced judgment.",2
What are your thoughts on climate change?,"I think climate change is nature���������s warning that we���������re not going the right way. Since humans are basically destroying lots of nature, it makes sense to me that the climate, which is part of nature, also changes. However, I don���������t know if this is something that we can fix or overcome in the near future. I think all of us should try ","part of nature, human destroy, unsure, should take action","Climate change is a significant and pressing global issue. It involves long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, largely driven by increased levels of greenhouse gases from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. The impacts of climate change are widespread, affecting weather patterns, sea levels, ecosystems, and human health. 

Addressing climate change requires coordinated international efforts to reduce emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and implement sustainable practices. Additionally, adaptation strategies are necessary to manage the effects that are already inevitable. Urgent and decisive action is essential to mitigate its impacts and ensure a sustainable future for our planet.",1,"I believe climate change is a critical issue that we all need to pay attention to. As someone from South Korea, I've seen how our country has been affected by changing weather patterns, and it's concerning. It's crucial for everyone, regardless of where we are, to be more conscious about our carbon footprint. I've noticed that people in the US are becoming more aware, but there���s still a lot of work to be done in terms of sustainable practices. Small changes, like reducing waste and using renewable energy sources, can make a big difference. It���s something that affects all of us globally, so cooperation and awaren",2,"As Jianna, I would say that climate change is a critical issue that affects us all globally. Being from South Korea, I'm aware of the noticeable impacts, such as increased typhoons and changing weather patterns. It's vital that countries work together to tackle this issue through technology, policy changes, and individual actions. Education and awareness are key, and everyone has a role to play in reducing carbon emissions and helping to create a sustainable future.",3

It is cheaper than buying as well! The only sad thing about this is that I cannot buy the butter that I really like since I could not find French butter in Bloomington. My other hobby is doing pretty nails, but since it is so expensive and I could not find a place that offers the design I like, I learned how to do gel nails by myself.
