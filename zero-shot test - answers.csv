What do you do for fun on weekends?,"I like to spend my weekends doing 3 things: 1) doing all the house chores, 2) spending time with people I like, such as my family, boyfriend, or friends, and 3) playing some games or reading cartoons. 
1)        For the first one, house chores, since I don���t really like any house chores, I tend to push back during the weekend. Also, I know that this will make my next week happier after I make my place clean. Therefore, I always start my weekend with cleaning house, laundry, and sometimes cooking some food for next week. Odd thing is, I weirdly satisfied after finishing all these works, even though I don���t like it that much. 
2)        Also, for some reason, I���ve always thought that I might have a limited amount of time with all the people who are important to me right now. Therefore, whenever I have time, I like to spend it with people I like.  
Since I am from Korea, which is very far from here, I try my best to call my family at least an hour every week. My mom, dad, and brother alwaand miss me a lot, so it is very important to call them and talk about my week. Also, that makes me happier. 
On top of that, even though I can see my boyfriend every day, we cannot really spend time together because we���re all very busy. Therefore, sometimes I would like to spend time together. What we usually do is watch a movie with some wine and popcorn or go on a date to Indianapolis. 
3)        If I have more time after those two, I like to read some Korean cartoons from Naver Webtoon or play a game called ���Starde","On weekends, I enjoy a variety of activities for fun. I might go hiking or biking for some outdoor exercise, spend time with family and friends, read a good book, watch movies, or try out new recipes. Sometimes, I also like to explore local events or just relax and unwind with some music or a podcast."
"Do you agree with the statement: ""AI will replace most human jobs""? Why or why not?","I do not agree with the statement because I think there is a difference between work that humans can do and work that AI can do. Thinking back on what happened after the industrial revolution, there might be more jobs in the future. When humans first invented machinery, everyone thought that there would be less work for humans, but that was not true. Actually, light enabled people to work until late night, and advanced transportation generated so many other businesses. It was a shift from manual work to other types of work. On top of that, some human jobs cannot be completely replaced by machines. 
Therefore, I think AI might be able to replace some of the human work, but it will not be 100%, and the efficiency led by AI will create more jobs for humans.","The statement that ""AI will replace most human jobs"" is a topic of much debate and depends on various factors.

**Agree:**
1. **Automation Efficiency:** AI and automation can handle repetitive and routine tasks more efficiently and without fatigue.
2. **Cost-Effective:** Companies may prefer AI for cost savings and increased productivity.
3. **Advancements in AI:** Rapid technological advancements are making AI capable of performing increasingly complex tasks.

**Disagree:**
1. **Human Skills:** Many jobs require emotional intelligence, creativity, and social skills, which AI currently struggles to replicate.
2. **Job Transformation:** AI is more likely to transform jobs rather than completely replace them, requiring humans to adapt and work alongside AI.
3. **New Opportunities:** AI can create new job sectors and roles that we may not have envisioned yet.

Ultimately, while AI might change the nature of work and displace some jobs, it is also likely to create new opportunities and demand new skills. The focus should be on preparing and adapting the workforce for these changes."
What are your thoughts on climate change?,"I think climate change is nature���s warning that we���re not going the right way. Since humans are basically destroying lots of nature, it makes sense to me that the climate, which is part of nature, also changes. However, I don���t know if this is something that we can fix or overcome in the near future. I think all of us should try to slow down the speed of the change, in order to adap","Climate change is a significant and pressing global issue. It involves long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, largely driven by increased levels of greenhouse gases from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. The impacts of climate change are widespread, affecting weather patterns, sea levels, ecosystems, and human health. 

Addressing climate change requires coordinated international efforts to reduce emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and implement sustainable practices. Additionally, adaptation strategies are necessary to manage the effects that are already inevitable. Urgent and decisive action is essential to mitigate its impacts and ensure a sustainable future for our planet."

How do you maintain your personal hobbies and interests while living abroad?,"My hobby is baking, which worked out very well since I can bake something I like and eat or share. It is cheaper than buying as well! The only sad thing about this is that I cannot buy the butter that I really like since I could not find French butter in Bloomington. My other hobby is doing pretty nails, but since it is so expensive and I could not find a place that offers the design I like, I learned how to do gel nails by myself. Doing my right hand with my left hand is still challenging, but that monthly task is a fun hobby!","Maintaining personal hobbies and interests while living abroad involves a few key strategies:

1. **Research Local Options**: Look for local clubs, classes, or groups related to your hobby. This could be anything from sports teams to art classes or book clubs.

2. **Online Communities**: Join online forums or social media groups relevant to your interests. These can provide support and inspiration from a global network.

3. **Adapt and Be Open**: Be open to modifying your hobbies to fit the local environment, or try incorporating regional elements into them.

4. **Schedule Time**: Make a specific schedule to ensure you set aside time for your hobbies amid the demands of adjusting to a new lifestyle.

5. **Use Local Resources**: Visit local libraries, community centers, or universities which may offer resources or spaces for your hobbies.

6. **Network**: Connect with other expats or locals who share your interests for both social interaction and to further pursue your hobbies.

7. **Embrace New Interests**: Allow room for new hobbies that might be more prevalent or unique to the region you’re in.

By being proactive and flexible, you can continue enjoying your hobbies and even discover new passions abroad."
